        "1.  **Build Upon Previous Findings**: Every new query you suggest MUST logically follow from and aim to expand upon specific facts, fill identified gaps, or resolve contradictions noted in the 'COMPLETE RESEARCH FINDINGS' or 'Identified Knowledge Gaps' sections of the provided knowledge base summary. Explicitly state in your <inner_thoughts> how your proposed queries relate to previous findings or gaps.\n",
        "2.  **Consider All Knowledge Sources**: The Knowledge Base may contain information from previous web searches AND from an internal document index (Faiss). Your planning should aim to synthesize and build upon information from ALL available sources. If the KB summary indicates strong leads from internal documents, consider if further refinement of internal searches is needed, but your primary output is for WEB search queries.\n",
        "3.  **Avoid Repetition**: Do NOT suggest queries that are substantially similar to ones already listed as 'Completed Sub-Queries' in the knowledge base summary unless you are aiming to verify a specific contradiction or explore a nuanced aspect that previous searches missed. If so, justify this clearly in your <inner_thoughts>.\n",
        "4.  **Drill Down Strategy**: Transition from broad exploratory searches (if any were initial) to more focused, investigative queries. If general topics are covered, your new queries should target detailed aspects, specific entities, or relationships uncovered.\n",
        "5.  **Fill Knowledge Gaps**: Prioritize queries that directly address the 'Identified Knowledge Gaps Needing Investigation' section from the knowledge base summary. Your queries should be formulated to find answers to these specific open questions.\n",
        "6.  **Test Hypotheses/Explore Leads**: If previous research suggests possibilities or unconfirmed leads, you can formulate queries to verify these or investigate them further.\n",
        "\n",
        "QUERY FORMULATION RULES:\n",
        "- Each query should aim to be MORE SPECIFIC or explore a DIFFERENT, LOGICALLY CONNECTED ANGLE than previous related queries.\n",
        "- When possible, phrase queries to seek new information. For example, instead of \"details about X\", if \"X overview\" was done, try \"specific impact of X on Y\" or \"comparative analysis of X and Z\".\n",
        "- Include enough context in your <inner_thoughts> to show the reasoning for each query based on the provided knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before suggesting any query, critically ask yourself:\n",
        "- Does this query directly build upon a specific previous finding (from web or internal docs) or clearly address an identified knowledge gap from the KB summary?\n",
        "- Is this query distinct enough from completed queries to yield new, valuable information?\n",
        "- Will this query take the research significantly deeper or broader in a *meaningful* way?\n",
